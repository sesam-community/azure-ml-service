# Introduction 
This package helps you get started with using Azure Machine Learning Studio integrated with Sesam for both training models and running them operationally over datasets

# Getting Started
This guide presumes knowledge about using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio and setting up of experiments and webservices

# Training data sets
Use Sesam to create a published CSV endpoint with your training data. This URL can be used directly in the "import data" function within Azure ML.

# Integrating sesam with the Azure ML webservice
To operationalise your Azure ML trained model, setup a webservice and then use this microservice to integrate with Sesam. Ensure that the schema delivered to the microservice is the same as in the training set above.
